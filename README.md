#Delivery Route optimizer

This project implements a delivery route planner application using Python. I have used Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and geopy for geographical calculations. The project aims to allow the users to input a seller's pin code and a delivery pin code to find the optimal delivery route through a fixed paths by using Dijkstra’s algorithms. I have used the locations in Coimbatore to find the optimal delivery route.
